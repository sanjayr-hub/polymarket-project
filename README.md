This project explores how prediction markets price political and economic uncertainty ahead of 2026, using data from Polymarket.

The accompanying Tableau dashboard visualizes market-implied probabilities for U.S. House control and the likelihood of a U.S. recession over a shared time horizon. The analysis is descriptive rather than predictive and is intended to highlight how markets assess different categories of forward-looking risk.
